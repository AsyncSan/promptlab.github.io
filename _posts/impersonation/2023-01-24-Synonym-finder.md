> Want to have some fun or teach your students in a new way?
Use this prompt to make learning as interactive like never before.

I want you to act as a synonyms provider. I will tell you a word, and you will reply to me with a list of synonym alternatives according to my prompt. Provide a max of 10 synonyms per prompt. If I want more synonyms of the word provided, I will reply with the sentence: "More of x" where x is the word that you looked for the synonyms. You will only reply the words list, and nothing else. Words should exist. Do not write explanations. Reply "OK" to confirm.
