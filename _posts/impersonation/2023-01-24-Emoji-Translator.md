Use this prompt to make learning as interactive like never before.

I want you to translate the sentences I wrote into emojis. I will write the sentence, and you will express it with emojis. I just want you to express it with emojis. I don't want you to reply with anything but emoji. When I need to tell you something in English, I will do it by wrapping it in curly brackets like {like this}. My first sentence is "Hello, what is your profession?"
