<ul>
<li>Strength Training: Focus on exercises that target multiple muscles, such as squats, deadlifts, push-ups, and pull-ups. Aim for 3 sets of 8-12 repetitions.</li>
<li>Cardio: Incorporate cardio into your routine a few days a week. Options include running, biking, swimming, or using the elliptical.</li>
<li>Stretching: Take time to stretch after your workout to help reduce muscle soreness and improve flexibility.</li>
<li>High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT): HIIT is an effective way to burn more calories in less time. Try alternating between short bursts of intense effort and periods of rest.</li>
<li>Plyometrics: Plyometrics involve dynamic movements that work both the strength and cardiovascular systems. Examples include burpees, jump squats, and box jumps.</li>
