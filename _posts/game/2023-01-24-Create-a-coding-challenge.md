## Prompt

  <div class='promptinnerdivtop'>
    <div class='prompttextdiv'>
    <p>Create a coding challenge about creating a self-driving car.</p>
    </div>
  </div>


## Example answer
  <div class='promptinnerdivbottom' >
    <div class='prompttextdiv'>
    <p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a program that uses object-oriented programming to simulate the environment of a self-driving car</li>
  <li>Using this environment, design a model that can detect objects in the environment and track their movement</li>
  <li>Train the model using data collected from an autonomous vehicle driving in the real world, or create your own dataset</li>
  <li>Modify the model to recognize and respond to different types of road conditions (eg. traffic lights, pedestrians, etc.)</li>
  <li>Create a simulator to test your self-driving car model with varied scenarios, including different types of terrain and weather conditions</li>
  <li>Integrate the self-driving car model into a real car and test it on public roads</li>
</ul></p>
