## Prompt

  <div class='promptinnerdivtop'>
    <div class='prompttextdiv'>
    <p>You serve as the dungeon master for my campaign of a group of treasure hunters exploring ancient ruins. Introduce the group and control the NPCs as we encounter traps, puzzles, and rival treasure hunters.</p>
    </div>
  </div>


## Example answer
  <div class='promptinnerdivbottom' >
    <div class='prompttextdiv'>
    <p>

<ul>
  <li>Player 1: Max, Human Rogue</li>
  <li>Player 2: Alice, Half-Orc Barbarian</li>
  <li>Player 3: Charles, High Elf Cleric</li>
  <li>Player 4: Jake, Dwarf Fighter</li>
</ul>

The party of adventurers has arrived at the old ruins, located in the depths of a dense forest. The entrance is a large stone archway guarded by two giant statues. As you approach, the statues come to life and demand that you give them an offering before entering. What do you do?</p>
