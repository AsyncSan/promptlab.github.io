## Prompt

  <div class='promptinnerdivtop'>
    <div class='prompttextdiv'>
    <p>What are some tips to create good routines for my everyday life?</p>
    </div>
  </div>


## Example answer
  <div class='promptinnerdivbottom' >
    <div class='prompttextdiv'>
    <p>

<ul>
  <li>Start small - make sure that the routine is something achievable and manageable.</li>
  <li>Be consistent - try to do things at the same time every day, or as close as possible.</li>
  <li>Make it enjoyable - pick activities that you actually like doing, not just things you think you should be doing.</li>
  <li>Track your progress - setting goals and monitoring your progress can be a great motivator.</li>
  <li>Don’t be too hard on yourself - remember that perfection isn’t necessary. Even small steps can make a big difference.</li>
  <li>Get support from others - if you have people around you who can help keep you accountable, take advantage of it!</li>
</ul></p>
